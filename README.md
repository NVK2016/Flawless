## Motivation : 

A major problem that people encounter when meeting anyone new is their inability to find common ground and similarities to connect upon. This problem often leads to uncomfortable and disengaging conversations and sometimes unfavorable impressions with the person you are meeting. Fortunately, this problem can easily be solved with a little homework and preparation using Flawless! 

### Functionality : 

By entering basic information on the occasion (business, social, or date) and the person(s) you are meeting, the Flawless application will pull from a variety of resources (Yelp API, The Movie DB API, News API) and successfully deliver the following information:

1. Restaurant / Bar / Meeting Suggestions - Based on both the occasion and food/mood of the evening
2. Popular Movies/TV Shows  Information - Keeping the user up to speed with pop culture and up to speed with trending         media
3. News/Current Events - Informing the user on important current event topics (general news, science, politics, sports,         finance, etc)
